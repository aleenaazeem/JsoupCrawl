Task:
First we had to crawl related to our project. Our project is about cloud storage service analysis. The website I am scraping and crawling is https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/. The steps taken to perform the lab were:
1.	First step was to crawl the website
2.	Store the information in html files
3.	We had to convert those html files to txt files
4.	Applied Java Regex to strip the phone number etc of any special characters such as dashes ‘-‘ or ‘@’
5.	Lastly, we searched for phone numbers, emails and urls. (The AWS didn’t have any phone numbers or emails)
